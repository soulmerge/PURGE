	abstract = {{<I>Design Patterns</I> is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design. It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application--a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs.} {Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! <P> Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. <P> First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of <i>Design Patterns</i> enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. <P> The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.}}

	year = {2002},
	keywords = {scene graph, Realtime Rendering, virtual reality},
	abstract = {This work covers the problems of scene graph systems. Currently used systems like Open Inventor or OpenGL Performer cover current and coming developments only partially. The work is concerned with three main parts: Extensibility, Parallelisation and Graphics Hardware Abstraction. Extensibility is a central problem given the quickly changing requirements posed by new applications. To support it new mechanisms are developed that allow dynamically extending the system. This concerns object creation as well as manipulation of objects, which is done via a reflectivity concept. The active components of the system, the traversals, have also been embedded into a new, extensible concept. Parallel processing is gaining importance due to the latest developments in processor and system architectures. In a VR application there are a number of independent tasks which can be executed in parallel and which access and anipulate the scene graph's data. To protect these from each other each task needs a private copy of the data. Using an appropriate synchronisation of accesses this division could be achieved using minimal memory overhead while allowing fast access and easy distribution of data between threads. Graphics hardware abstraction is forced by the growing diversification in the graphics board market. At the same time algorithms to create real time displays are moving further and further away from the classic, simple approaches and switch to using multiple stages and/or passes to create the final image. To give an application a usable access to these features without burdening it with too many details an extensible method to encapsulate the OpenGL state has mbeen developed, which together with a new structure called DrawTree is used optimize and abstract the display tasks. The central algorithms and methods developed in this work have been implemented in the free OpenSG system (www.opensg.org). It is used and enhanced by a number of universities and research institutes.},
