In this context, the aim of this thesis is to create an API that is easy to grasp for developers without specific knowledge of graphics engine implementation and usage. The resulting graphics engine called PURGE\footnote{PURGE is an acronym for \textbf{PUR}istic \textbf{G}raphics \textbf{E}ngine. The library has no hard dependencies to other libraries.} is expected to handle as many unspecified-but-necessary parameters as possible with default values that try to predict the developers expectation. This behavior will most certainly lead to sub-optimal results, but permits fast draft implementations.

The question is: is it possible to create a 3D graphics engine that can be used by developers that have no prior experience developing graphics applications. And what impact does it have on the usability, readability and performance of the applications making use of such an API?

With these premises, the API presented in this thesis supports fast development, with the option of optimizing the resulting application at the end of a development cycle as propagated by \cite{Knuth:1974:SPG:356635.356640}.
